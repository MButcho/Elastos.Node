# FAQ

### Do I need to install all chains or programs?

### What are the lsof warnings, how to remove them?

### How to check or verify the node is working smoothly?

### How to get the Public Key of a supernode?

```bash
# Show ELA wallet address and public key
cd ~/node/ela
cat ~/.config/elastos/ela.txt | ./ela-cli wallet account
```

### How to check the current height of an ELA node?

```bash
~/node/node.sh ela status | grep Height
```

ELA daemon will verify the database when booting, this may take several minutes. The height will be shown as N/A before the verification.

To check the progress of the verification, you can run:

```
cd ~/node/ela/elastos/logs/node
tail -f $(ls -1 *.log | sort -r | head -1)
# CTRL+C to stop
```

### What is PayToAddr?

### When the setup is done? How to associate this node to my ...?

### How to check the status of an CR Council Member's Supernode?

Active / Inactive

### How to activate an ELA Supernode?

The ELA DPOS super node did not have normal consensus work within 1440 blocks, and the node status was set to Inactive. The DPOS super node and CR's DPOS super node send the activation transaction and the status is set to Active and Elected after 6 blocks. The DPOS super node is successfully activated, and will participate in the consensus work normally after 36-72 blocks.

Activate Node

```bash
$ ~/node/ela/ela-cli wallet buildtx producer activate --nodepublickey nodepublickey
$ ~/node/ela/ela-cli --rpcuser user123 --rpcpassword pass123 wallet sendtx -f ready_to_send.txn
```

### How to check node normal consensus? How to verify all daemons are working properly?

The ELA main chain is generated by the consensus of DPOS super nodes. The side chain ESC and EID will dynamically perceive the DPOS super nodes of CR and are responsible for the consensus generation of blocks. All side chain nodes need to verify the side chain blocks and reach a consensus.

* ELA

```
    1. ELA node height can be synchronized normally and has the highest height
    2. The status of the DPOS super node is obtained by querying the listproducers interface. The node status is Active, which means it is in the active state.
    3. The status of the DPOS super node of CR is obtained by querying the listcurrentcrs interface. The node status is Elected, which means it is active.
    4. CR's DPOS super node needs to obtain the DPOS super node of the current consensus, which can be obtained through the getarbiterpeersinfo interface, and the return is empty. Its own CR DPOS super node does not participate in the consensus
```

* DID

```
    1. DID node height can be synchronized normally and has the highest height
```

* ESC

```
    1. ESC node height can be synchronized normally and has the highest height
    2. CR's DPOS super node needs to obtain the ESC node that is on-duty consensus, which can be obtained through the pbft_getAtbiterPeersInfo interface. If an error is returned, its own ESC node does not participate in the consensus.
```

* EID

```
    1. EID node height can be synchronized normally and has the highest height
    2. CR's DPOS super node needs to obtain the EID node that is on-duty consensus, which can be obtained through the pbft_getAtbiterPeersInfo interface. If an error is returned, its own EID node does not participate in the consensus.
```

* Arbiter

```
    1. ELA, DID, ESC, EID, ELA SPV heights of Arbiter nodes can be synchronized normally and have the highest height
```
