### How to activate an ELA Supernode

The ELA DPOS super node did not have normal consensus work within 1440 blocks, and the node status was set to Inactive. The DPOS super node and CR's DPOS super node send the activation transaction and the status is set to Active and Elected after 6 blocks. The DPOS super node is successfully activated, and will participate in the consensus work normally after 36-72 blocks.

Activate Node

```bash
$ ~/node/ela/ela-cli wallet buildtx producer activate --nodepublickey nodepublickey
$ ~/node/ela/ela-cli --rpcuser user123 --rpcpassword pass123 wallet sendtx -f ready_to_send.txn
```

### How to check node normal consensus

The ELA main chain is generated by the consensus of DPOS super nodes. The side chain ESC and EID will dynamically perceive the DPOS super nodes of CR and are responsible for the consensus generation of blocks. All side chain nodes need to verify the side chain blocks and reach a consensus.

* ELA

```
    1. ELA node height can be synchronized normally and has the highest height
    2. The status of the DPOS super node is obtained by querying the listproducers interface. The node status is Active, which means it is in the active state.
    3. The status of the DPOS super node of CR is obtained by querying the listcurrentcrs interface. The node status is Elected, which means it is active.
    4. CR's DPOS super node needs to obtain the DPOS super node of the current consensus, which can be obtained through the getarbiterpeersinfo interface, and the return is empty. Its own CR DPOS super node does not participate in the consensus
```

* DID

```
    1. DID node height can be synchronized normally and has the highest height
```

* ESC

```
    1. ESC node height can be synchronized normally and has the highest height
    2. CR's DPOS super node needs to obtain the ESC node that is on-duty consensus, which can be obtained through the pbft_getAtbiterPeersInfo interface. If an error is returned, its own ESC node does not participate in the consensus.
```

* EID

```
    1. EID node height can be synchronized normally and has the highest height
    2. CR's DPOS super node needs to obtain the EID node that is on-duty consensus, which can be obtained through the pbft_getAtbiterPeersInfo interface. If an error is returned, its own EID node does not participate in the consensus.
```

* Arbiter

```
    1. ELA, DID, ESC, EID, ELA SPV heights of Arbiter nodes can be synchronized normally and have the highest height
```
