# Elastos Node

The Elastos blockchain consists of the main chain and multiple sidechains.

Types of Elastos blockchain networks:

* MainNet - The real blockchain and network, monetary value, and all the actual transactions that occur.
* TestNet - TestNet is a parallel blockchain to MainNet, used only for testing and development.
* RegTest - A regression test network is almost identical to the MainNet but is for private development. External connections are not enabled.

The Elastos blockchain network consists of Elastos nodes.

Types of Elastos nodes by common features:

* Pure verification nodes
* Mining nodes
* Supernodes
* Full nodes
* Light nodes

Types of Elastos nodes by Elastos features:

* Normal nodes
* BPoS Supernodes (Normal) - ELA
* BPoS Supernodes (CR Council Member) - ELA, ESC, EID, Arbiter

Types of Elastos nodes by who operates:

* Mining Pools
* Crypto Exchanges
* Developers
* Community Members
* CR Council Members

So we may find:

* An Elastos node may contain one or more components: blockchain daemons, services and supporting programs.
* And different people or roles may need different types of Elastos nodes.
