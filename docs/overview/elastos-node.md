# Elastos Node

The Elastos blockchain consists of the main chain and multiple sidechains.

Types of Elastos blockchain networks:

* MainNet - The real blockchain and network, monetary value, and all the real transactions take place.
* TestNet - TestNet is a parallel blockchain to MainNet, used only for testing and development.
* RegTest - A regression test network is almost identical to the MainNet, but it is for private development. External connections are not enabled.

The Elastos blockchain network consists of Elastos nodes.

Types of Elastos nodes, by common features:

* Pure verification nodes
* Mining nodes
* Supernodes
* Full nodes
* Light nodes

Types of Elastos Nodes by features, by Elastos features:

* Normal nodes
* DPoS Supernodes (Normal) - ELA
* DPoS Supernodes (CR Council Member) - ELA, DID, ESC, EID, Arbiter

Types of Elastos nodes, by who operates:

* Mining Pools
* Crypto Exchanges
* Developers
* Community Members
* CR Council Members

So we may find:

* An Elastos node may contain one or more components, which consists of blockchain daemons or services and the supporting programs.
* And different people or roles may need different Elastos nodes.
