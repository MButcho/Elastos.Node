# node.sh

**node.sh** is a wrapper script to help you manage your Elastos nodes relatively easily.

To setup, manage or operate an Elastos node, you may have to do the following deployment works:

* Installation
* Starting
* Stopping
* Updating
* Tracking versions
* Monitoring
* Uninstallation

It seems easy and straightforward, but actually a little complicated and error-prone. Especially considering Elastos blockchain has multiple components and modes.

We wish to share a basic and effective way to manage a node. It is for entry-level to mid-level users, especially if you have not prepared or brewed a similar solution.

node.sh integrates some frequently-used operations and provides a command-line interface in an all-in-one, intuitive, and consistent way.

node.sh supports:

* **Operating System**: Ubuntu Linux x86\_64 18.04 or higher
* **Elastos Network**: MainNet (will add TestNet support, if developers think this script is useful)
* ****[**Chains**](overview/programs-supported-by-node.sh.md): Elastos main chain, sidechains, the arbitrator
