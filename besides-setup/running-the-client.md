# Running the Client

_TODO: Implement the shortcut command to call the ela-cli command, this auto-pass the  RPC username and password, which saves the users' time._

Put one, two or three simple command lines to call node features.

Next:

1. Please check ela-cli command-line usage
2. Please check JSON RPC API
